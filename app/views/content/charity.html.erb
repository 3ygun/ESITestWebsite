      <h4>Tutoring at Gladden Community House</h4>
      <h6>Mondays during the School Year</h6>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="large-8 columns">
          <p>The Gladden Community House is a beacon of light for the youth of Franklinton and its surrounding neighborhoods. Gladden offers many services for its kids, from summer day camp to after school recreation. E-Sports Initiative reaches out to the Franklinton community, whose graduation rate is less than 50%, by tutoring at the Homework Help Center. Each day, after school, groups of kids will come to the HHC for help with their homework or even just to spend some time with the tutors. ESI members will play board games, read books and practice flash cards with the kids. We also try to encourage students to pursue a college degree by talking about our own college lives. Most of the kids in the community have rough family lives and lack a good adult role model. Throughout the year, we develop a strong relationship with our students and help them to grow. ESI hopes to positively impact these young minds and aid them in making the best of their futures. If you are interested in getting involved at the Gladden Community House, contact Dennis Lam at <a href="mailto:lam.145@osu.edu">lam.145@osu.edu</a> or Whitney Vosler at <a href="mailto:whitneyvosler.gch@gmail.com">whitneyvosler.gch@gmail.com</a>.</p>

      <h3>Volunteering at the Society of Women Engineers Career Fair</h3>
      <h6>2/6/2013</h6>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="large-8 columns">
          <p>Needing volunteers to assist companies at the Society of Women Engineers Career Fair, E-Sports Initiative was asked to send members and we gladly obliged. The SWE Career Fair is a yearly event hosted by The Ohio State University at its Student Union to allow promising students in the fields of Engineering and Computer Science to get in touch with professionals from relevant fields. We were assigned the first shift to help representatives with parking and setting up their booths. This involved answering any questions in regards to parking and booth space, in addition to helping representatives transport heavy equipment into the building. This was a great experience for ESI, as we got the chance to talk to a lot of different representatives from various engineering and computer science focused companies on a very personal level. Hopefully, ESI will have to opportunity to lend a helping hand in the future as well.</p>

    <h3>Clean Up Columbus</h3>
    <h6>12/2/2012</h6>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="large-8 columns">
        <p>Throughout the academic year, OSUâ€™s Undergraduate Student Government hosts multiple Clean Up Columbus events. E-Sports Initiative sends its members to participate in this collaborative event with other student organizations to help clean the off-campus community. ESI members spend two hours picking up litter off of the streets. We look forward to participating in each event over the future years in hopes of continuing towards a clean campus, clean community, and clean Columbus.</p>
