      <h3>ESI Spring 2013 Starcraft 2 Tournament</h3>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="large-6 columns">
          <p>On March 30th, 2013, E-Sports Initiative hosted its
            first StarCraft 2 tournament with about 50 participating
            players along with another 50 spectators who came to
            support ESI and StarCraft 2.  Sponsors such as Razer,
            Major League Gaming (MLG), and iBuyPower also
            believed in our ability to create a high profile event
            and provided prizes which included a keyboard, headset,
            mouse, and a very high quality personal computer.

      <p>Due to the success of this tournament, E-Sports Initiative
        will definitely hold another StarCraft 2 Tournament during
        the Autumn Semester of 2013. </p>

          <p>After a grueling series of online matches, the top 8 teams that made it through the group stages met up in the Student Union to duke it out for first place in ESI’s second League of Legends Tournament. Many great matches were played throughout the day, having been streamed to a big screen for friends and fans in a viewing room.

      <p>However, at the end of the day, only one team can claim the title of champion. We would like to congratulate the team  Kony 2012 for managing to do just that, having unexpectedly turned the tables on all odds and won all matches the finals despite being one of the lower seeds. They have each walked away with an extra 20$ in RP in their in-game pockets, in addition to the shiny exclusive skin only available to winners of tournaments – Triumphant Ryze.
